### Software
* [AES Encryption golang and python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35811119/aes-encryption-golang-and-python) *(stackoverflow.com)*  
  Beware when using encryption between golang and python, they use different type of segments, python uses 8-bit segments while Go uses 128-bit segments.
* [Typesense](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/building-a-search-application.html#faceting) *(typesense.org)*
  Small and fast open source Search, support batching insert, in data-set of 1 million data the searching can be done in 2ms, amazing.

  Jeff Kreeftmeijer shares how to automate git branching workflow, old tools but powerfull
* [Orchestrator](https://github.com/openark/orchestrator) *(github.com/openark)*

  Beware the path, in my experience can't set breakpoint because the workspace is in symlink mode (I'm using Linux btw), just using the REAL PATH.

  River Phillips shares how to increase GC cycle Golang app in container
