Description: tukangketik/genoa, tools for Lumen boilerplate CRUD Rest API 
---

Just release mini tools for generating boilerplate REST API ready (CRUD) from Open Api v3 spec. This is first time I'm submitting to packagist.org and also first time posting to linkedin. It's never too late to start something new.

I know it's not really great, but it's help me generate boilerplate apps fast.
